.NAME
    ClusterNetwork

.DESCRIPTION
    Configures a cluster network in a failover cluster.

    This resource is only able to change properties on cluster networks.
    To add or remove networks from the cluster, add or remove them from
    the cluster members. By adding a new subnet on one of the cluster
    nodes, the network will be added to the cluster, and metadata can be
    set using the ClusterNetwork module.

    ## Requirements

    * Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.

    ## Parameters

    ### Role

    This parameter sets the role of the cluster network. If the cluster network role
    is not in desired state it will change to match this role.

    The cluster network role can be set to either the value 0, 1 or 3.

    0 = Do not allow cluster network communication
    1 = Allow cluster network communication only
    3 = Allow cluster network communication and client connectivity

    See this article for more information about cluster network role values;

.PARAMETER Address
    Key - String
    The address for the cluster network in the format '10.0.0.0'.

.PARAMETER AddressMask
    Key - String
    The address mask for the cluster network in the format '255.255.255.0'.

.PARAMETER Name
    Write - String
    The name of the cluster network. If the cluster network name is not in desired state it will be renamed to match this name.

.PARAMETER Role
    Write - String
    Allowed values: 0, 1, 3
    The role of the cluster network. If the cluster network role is not in desired state it will change to match this role.

.PARAMETER Metric
    Write - String
    The metric number for the cluster network. If the cluster network metric number is not in desired state it will be changed to match this metric number.

.EXAMPLE 1

This example shows how to change the properties Name, Role and Metric of two
failover cluster network resources in the failover cluster.

.NOTES
This example assumes the failover cluster is already present.
